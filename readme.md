## Background and Overview
SpiraSketch is a web app inspired by the [Spirograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph).

A drawing "compass" with multiple rotors traces out a curve known as a roulette curve. Users can input custom parameters to change the radii and speeds of each rotor. 

SpiraSketch uses Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

## Features

Users can control the drawing with the control panel on the right side. There are three randomization options, two drawing mode options, and a panel for users to enter custom inputs. 

The three randomization options are: 
  * Simple: (2-5 rotors, maximum ratio for each rotor: 6)

  * Spiral: (2 rotors, no maximum ratio)

  * Complex: (2-9 rotors, no maximum ratio)
